Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain without external assistance:

The fundamentals of a hash function
Characteristics of a good hash function
The workings and utilization of hash tables
Techniques for handling collisions in a hash table
Advantages and disadvantages of using hash tables
Common use cases for hash tables
Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation: GCC on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with specific options (-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89)
File Formatting: Follow the Betty style guidelines
Restrictions: No global variables, limit of 5 functions per file
Header Files: Functions' prototypes to be included in hash_tables.h
Data Structures
For this project, utilize the following data structures:

hash_node_t: Node structure of a hash table
hash_table_t: Structure of the hash table data
Tasks
The project encompasses several tasks involving the creation of hash tables, hash functions, handling keys, adding elements, retrieving values, printing hash tables, and deleting hash tables.

Advanced Task (Task 7)
For advanced learners, an additional task is provided that requires the implementation of ordered hash tables, using a sorted linked list for managing key-value pairs.

File Structure
The project directory includes multiple .c files corresponding to different tasks along with their associated header files. Each task demonstrates different functionalities related to hash tables in C.

Additional Notes
The project emphasizes original solutions and prohibits plagiarism.
Memory management is crucial. Leaks and errors need to be minimized.
